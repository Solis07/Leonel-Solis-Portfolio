## Description

Advanced CSS Properties:

For this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating my portfolio from scratch using advanced css that will display some of my future designs. All of the following criteria was met for the assignment. My portfolio contains a header with working links to each section, a work section containing my future projects that will be displayed, and a contact section containing my socials.
